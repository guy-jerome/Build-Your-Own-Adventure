# Build-Your-Own-Adventure
A collabrative website where that provides a framework for easily creating and sharing build-your-own-adventures. 

The project is something called Build Your Own Adventure. The concept is simple, it is a platform where users can create Choose-Your-Own-Adventures, play them, and share them. There is a simple landing page where the user can check out Adventures created by other users, go to the Adventure Builder, or log in. To build and share adventures, a user must make an account, but an account is not needed to play other peopleâ€™s adventures. If the user does not have an account, there is a register page where they can make an account. Lastly, each registered user has a profile page that shows the adventures that they have made.


This is just a test to check if I understand how to use the branching system outside of the CLI.
